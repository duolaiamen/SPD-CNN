## Introduction

To build a robust classiﬁcation algorithm for a calibration-less BCI systemcalibration-less BCI system, we propose an end-to-end model that
transforms the EEG signals into symmetric positive deﬁnite (SPD) matrices and captures the features of SPD matrices by using a CNN. To avoid the
time-consuming calibration and ensure the application of the proposed model, we use the meta-transfer-learning (MTL) method to learn the essential
features from different subjects.The main Figure are shown below.
